        Why Containerization?

• Containerization is a standardized way to package the application with its dependencies and deploy it on any environment. 

• Docker is a tool used to create, deploy, and run applications usingcontainers. 

• It makes it easy to deploy and run applications in a repeatable and secure. 

• Docker allows applications to run on separate machines with the same operating.

        CONTAINERS VS VITUAL MACHINES

VM                                                      DOCKER CONTAINER

* occupies a lot of memory space                        * occupies less memory space
* Bootup time is long                                   * Bootup time is less
* Multiple running Virtual Machine leads to unstable    * Multiple diff host OS containers run efficiently
* Difficult to scale up                                 * Easy to scale up
* low efficency                                         * High efficiency 

        Advantages of docker 
• Low system requirements

• Quick application portability

• Local development environment

• Continous integration and deployment

• Code isolation 

• Increased efficiency 


        Docker Architecture

*  Docker Daemon: It runs on host OS & responsible for running containers to manage docker service

• It communicating with other daemons

• It offers various docker objects such images, containers, networking & volume.

* Docker Client: It is a command line interface tool that allows user to interact with
  Docker Daemon. It send commands to Docker Daemon & receives response

* Docker Host: It provides environment to execute and run the application

• It contains docker daemon,images,containers,networks & storage

* Docker Registry: It manages and stores the Docker images

• Two types of Docker Registry are

1) Public Registry: Docker hub
2) Private Registry: Images share within enterprise       

* Docker Network: Docker provides build in network infrastructure that allows
 containers to communicate with each other & with the host machine.

* Docker Image: It is a read only template that contain set of instructions for creating
  docker container.

* Docker Container: It is a run time environment to images with updating all its
  dependencies to run applications.

* Docker volume: It is a persistent data storage mechanism that can be used to store
  data outside of a container's file system.

        Working with Docker Containers

$ docker version : To check detailed docker version

$ docker –v : To check short-info docker version

$ docker search imagename : To search image name (e.g. docker search ubuntu)

$ docker pull imagename: To pull image from dockerhub (e.g. docker pull ubuntu)

$ docker images: To list images

$ docker run –it - -name newcontainer imagename: To enter inside container
(e.g. docker run –it - -name mycont ubuntu)

ctrl+p+ctrl+q : exit container without stoppping

$ docker ps: To check running container

$ docker run -it imagename: To go inside the container with random name

$ docker ps —a : To list Running and stopped container

$ docker stop containername: To stop running container

$ docker kill containername :- To stop container suddenly

$ docker rm containername: To delete stopped container

$ docker start containername: To start contamer

$ docker rmi imagename: To delete image name

$ docker run —i —d - -name newcontainername imagename

$ docker exec —it containername /bin/bash

$ docker diff containername : To see any updates or logs in the image

Output shows: C-changed, A-appended(add), D-Deleted
$ docker commit runcontainername newimagename: To create new image from running container

        Docker Swarm 
        
• A Docker Swarm is a container orchestration/management tool running the Docker application.

• It has been configured to join together in a cluster. The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager,
  and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

• A swarm consists of multiple Docker hosts which run in Swarm mode and act as managers, to manage membership 
  and delegation, and workers, which run swarmservices. A given Docker host can be a manager, a worker, or perform both roles.        

        Docker Swarm Advantages

• Easy to use: Docker Swarm is relatively easy to set up and use, even for those who are new to container orchestration. 

• Scalability: Docker Swarm can scale to manage a large number of Docker hosts. 

• High availability: Docker Swarm can provide high availability for your applications by automatically restarting failed containers. 

• Load balancing: Docker Swarm can automatically distribute traffic across your containers. 

• Rolling updates: Docker Swarm can perform rolling updates of your applications, which means that you can update your applications without any downtime. 

• Security: Docker Swarm provides a number of security features, such as encryption and role-based access control. 

• Monitoring: Docker Swarm provides a number of monitoring features, which can help you to track the performance of your applications. 

• Limited functionality: Docker Swarm is a simpler tool than Kubernetes, and as a result, it has fewer features. 

• Limited scalability: Docker Swarm is not as scalable as Kubernetes. It can be difficult to manage large swarms, and they can be more prone to failure. 

• Limited third-party support: There are fewer third-party tools and resources available for Docker Swarm than for Kubernetes. 

• Steeper learning curve: Docker Swarm is a more complex tool than Docker Compose, and it can take some time to learn how to use it effectively. 

• Limited fault tolerance: If a manager node fails, the swarm can become unavailable.
